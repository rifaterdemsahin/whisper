  transcription: ' What I''m doing is for the V-rolls, I''m putting all these A-rolls
    and then the V-rolls are becoming like a afterthought, what I don''t want is.
    I don''t want the dictation to direct the video, but the V-rolls are outlined
    or the make-up is the A-roll, but the V-rolls, they call it the V-rolls. Not is
    a second thought, but is a first that''s in the video.'

  transcription: ' So what we are doing here is we are focusing with the phone and
    the neck mount. Right now it''s in my hand and I want to make sure that I am focusing
    on the V-rolls as much as possible, no more than 16 seconds, but recorded so I
    can share it with others. I hope there is not too much tilt.'

  transcription: ' And once I create the footage and the footage is going to be all
    about the project that I''m working on, especially on here. What I have it in
    the background, I have all the folder structures to be able to do this. And my
    plan is to be able to support the users, Chirp Noval, Tommy in the contract. So
    I can help them in this process much easier so they can say, all right, we got
    something out of this. And this is useful.'

  transcription: ' I said explain the first principles for usefulness that was the
    core issue with the Elon Musk that I got. For the first principles approach what
    I see it is what works and in terms of the users is my case though. And when I
    look into this it talks about the SpaceX Apple iPhone. Those are much bigger terms
    though but my first take is break down into complex problems into fundamental
    truths. Not even to the customer but to the user that I am focusing on. Useful
    and useful encouraging creativity what I am trying to do. That is important. I
    am working with a friend of mine. I am sharing all the details with him. I want
    to make sure that the graphano automation works with him. I am sharing him the
    eraser. I own the tools that I am using to be able to build this and what I see
    and what I understand during this process is important. It is not very straightforward
    all the time and there is all these distractions that is coming up in life. And
    that is also normal. They are normal for me. But I will be able to say this is
    a graphano. This is a graphano renderer that comes in and this is going to get
    consumed by rendering between them. I will call this one and this will call the
    graphano renderer.'

  transcription: ' As I said for my personal experience I had to move into the storage
    unit and once you move into the storage unit what I realized is I have to make
    sure that I need to let go of the old concepts that I had on the boxes, the voiceovers
    are not going to be perfect and some of the compute that I won''t be able to use.
    So it is a cleaning process for myself.'

  transcription: ' I''m using diagrams like Mermaid, but I''m also moving to diagrams
    like Razer I.O. Getting the feedback from the AI partner that I got. So it is
    also important for me to be able to move on and be able to iterate through this
    process. And see there is the bot, a document, and a canvas approach which I was
    looking for in fact and this is giving me that outlook.'

  transcription: ' On the customer development site what I understood is I''m going
    to go back and the tap is mostly about the user and the IT people and the customer
    is the enterprises so I will go back to the hypothesis and test problem hypothesis
    and make sure that the free users to the paid sus customers I will not try to
    force that too hard but make sure that I''m useful for jukes for Tommy for now
    all the people in the contract before I go ahead and try to build anything around

    LinkedIn and once you go to LinkedIn, there is a project section down below after
    your licenses and certifications. There is the projects and I have to add these
    projects in a meaningful manner and it also weighs nearly seven contributors and
    the Github reports that are related to it. It is the key part of what I am trying
    to do.'

    figure out, but I will start talking to myself in that approach in the framework,
    which will make my life easier, all the folders, all the comets that I''m doing
    is a conversation with yourself. You need to be able to find the motivation for
    you to be able to talk to the machines and be able to come up with solutions.'
