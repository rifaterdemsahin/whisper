### The Story of the Grafana Automation Project ðŸ“ŠðŸš€

In a workspace dedicated to **Grafana automation**, a team led by @rifaterdemsahin embarked on a journey to develop an automated solution for Grafana, using cutting-edge technologies and methods. Hereâ€™s the story, told through the structure of their work:

---

#### **1. Journey: Setting the Stage**  
At the heart of the project lies the `1_Journey` folder, which marks the initial steps toward a fully functional Grafana setup. Key documents like `README.md` and `proof_of_concept.md` lay out the projectâ€™s vision and early ideas, giving the team a clear direction. The journey is about more than just setting up Grafanaâ€”it's about envisioning a complete system of monitoring and rendering.

#### **2. Real: Defining Real-World Goals**  
The `2_Real` folder captures the projectâ€™s transition from theory to practice. The `okr.md` document highlights the real objectives and key results the team aims to achieve, focusing on practical applications. The folder brings clarity to the real-world implementation of Grafana, making the vision tangible.

#### **3. Environment: Building the Foundation**  
The `3_Environment` folder houses the necessary configurations and setup information, such as the `minikube_environment.md` file. Here, the team establishes the environment for their Grafana instance, ensuring that the system is ready to be deployed and tested.

#### **4. UI: Visualizing the Future**  
A major part of the project is ensuring Grafanaâ€™s user interface is effective and appealing. Inside the `4_UI` folder, the team shares images like `grafana_console.png` and `Grafana_dummy_dashboard.png`, along with detailed documents like `installing_grafana.md`. These resources help guide the creation of dashboards and the configuration of essential Grafana features, including the setup of the **Image Renderer plugin**. The folder also includes guides for advanced configurations like `port_forwarding.md`.

#### **5. Formula: Executing the Plan**  
The `5_Formula` folder dives into the technical detailsâ€”scripts, commands, and step-by-step guides. Here, documents like `install_grafana_image_renderer.md` and `serve_json_apply_kubernetes_files.md` explain how to set up various components, while others like `curl_commands.md` provide the necessary commands to interact with Grafana's API. This folder is where the teamâ€™s formula for success is tested and refined.

#### **6. Symbols: Defining the Building Blocks**  
The `6_Symbols` folder contains essential building blocks such as YAML files (`dummy_data_configmap.yaml`, `updated_values.yaml`), server configurations (`server.py`), and even mock data (`dummy.json`). These are the symbolic pieces that represent both the structure and the data needed to bring the Grafana system to life, ensuring the automation runs smoothly.

#### **7. Semblance: Bringing It All Together**  
Finally, the `7_Semblance` folder includes the `README.md`, which is the wrapping document that explains the purpose of the entire project. It serves as the bridge between all the steps taken, helping the team reflect on how all the components fit together and function as a cohesive whole.
