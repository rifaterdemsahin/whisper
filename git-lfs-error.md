It looks like you're encountering issues with pushing large files to GitHub. GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB for individual files. To handle larger files, you can use Git Large File Storage (LFS). Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:

1. **Install Git LFS**:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Track the large files**:
   You need to tell Git LFS to track the large files. For example:
   ```sh
   git lfs track "*.MOV"
   git lfs track "*.mp4"
   ```

3. **Add the tracked files**:
   ```sh
   git add .gitattributes
   git add 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/IMG_7314.MOV
   git add 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/RPReplay_Final1735380819.mp4
   ```

4. **Commit the changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
   ```

5. **Push the changes**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to push your large files to GitHub without encountering the file size limit error[1](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/61221)[2](https://trycatchdebug.net/news/1341032/large-file-github-limit).
