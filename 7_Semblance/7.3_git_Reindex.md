It sounds like the large files might still be present in your commit history, even though you've deleted them from your working directory. To resolve this, you can use the `git filter-branch` command to remove the large files from your commit history. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Remove the large files from the commit history**:
   ```sh
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/IMG_7314.MOV 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/RPReplay_Final1735380819.mp4' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Clean up the backup refs created by `git filter-branch`**:
   ```sh
   rm -rf .git/refs/original/
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now
   git gc --aggressive --prune=now
   ```

3. **Force push the changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main --force
   ```

These steps will remove the large files from your commit history and allow you to push your changes to GitHub without encountering the file size limit error[1](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/61221)[2](https://trycatchdebug.net/news/1341032/large-file-github-limit).

It looks like you have unstaged changes that need to be committed or stashed before you can proceed with the `git filter-branch` command. Hereâ€™s how you can handle this:

1. **Stage all changes**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Staging changes before filter-branch"
   ```

Alternatively, if you don't want to commit these changes, you can stash them:

1. **Stash the changes**:
   ```sh
   git stash
   ```

After staging or stashing your changes, you can proceed with the `git filter-branch` command.

However, since `git filter-branch` has many pitfalls and is not recommended for most use cases, you might want to use `git filter-repo` instead. It is a safer and more efficient tool for rewriting Git history. Hereâ€™s how you can use `git filter-repo`:

1. **Install `git filter-repo`**:
   ```sh
   pip install git-filter-repo
   ```

2. **Use `git filter-repo` to remove the large files**:
   ```sh
   git filter-repo --path 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/IMG_7314.MOV --path 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/RPReplay_Final1735380819.mp4 --invert-paths
   ```

3. **Force push the changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main --force
   ```

Using `git filter-repo` should help you avoid the issues associated with `git filter-branch`[1](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch)[2](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).
