It sounds like the large files might still be present in your commit history, even though you've deleted them from your working directory. To resolve this, you can use the `git filter-branch` command to remove the large files from your commit history. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Remove the large files from the commit history**:
   ```sh
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/IMG_7314.MOV 6_Symbols/vroll_dec1/RPReplay_Final1735380819.mp4' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Clean up the backup refs created by `git filter-branch`**:
   ```sh
   rm -rf .git/refs/original/
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now
   git gc --aggressive --prune=now
   ```

3. **Force push the changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main --force
   ```

These steps will remove the large files from your commit history and allow you to push your changes to GitHub without encountering the file size limit error[1](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/61221)[2](https://trycatchdebug.net/news/1341032/large-file-github-limit).
