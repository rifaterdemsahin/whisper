To get just the output of your command without all the additional information, you can redirect the standard output and error to a file or filter the output using tools like `grep` or `awk`. Here are a few methods:

1. **Redirect Output to a File**:
   ```bash
   python vrollprocess.pl > output.txt 2>&1
   ```

2. **Filter Output Using `grep`**:
   ```bash
   python vrollprocess.pl 2>&1 | grep -v "ffmpeg version"
   ```

3. **Using `awk` to Filter Specific Lines**:
   ```bash
   python vrollprocess.pl 2>&1 | awk '/@rifaterdemsahin/ {print}'
   ```

These commands will help you capture or filter the output to focus on the specific information you need. Let me know if you need further assistance!
