Downloading videos from Google Drive requires proper authentication and permissions. Here's a Python script using the `pydrive` library to download all videos from a Google Drive folder. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the folder.

First, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pydrive
```

Then, use the following script:

```python
from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive
import os

# Authenticate and create the PyDrive client
gauth = GoogleAuth()
gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()  # Creates local webserver and automatically handles authentication.
drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)

# Folder ID from the shared link
folder_id = '171Ugo7SKzAzTTcEi5ep2VhuMN7UZB4bz'

# List all files in the folder
file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': f"'{folder_id}' in parents and trashed=false"}).GetList()

# Download all video files
for file in file_list:
    if file['mimeType'].startswith('video/'):
        print(f'Downloading {file["title"]}...')
        file.GetContentFile(file['title'])

print('All videos downloaded successfully.')
```

This script will:
1. Authenticate your Google account.
2. List all files in the specified Google Drive folder.
3. Download all files with a MIME type starting with 'video/'.

Make sure to follow the authentication steps provided by `pydrive` to set up your credentials. If you need to extract the videos, you can use libraries like `ffmpeg` or `moviepy` depending on your requirements.
