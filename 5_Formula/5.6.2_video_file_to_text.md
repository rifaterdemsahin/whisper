To convert an MP4 file to text for transcription on a Windows environment, you can use a tool like `ffmpeg` to extract the audio and then use a speech-to-text service like `Whisper` from OpenAI. Here are the steps:

1. **Install ffmpeg**:
    Download and install `ffmpeg` from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. **Extract audio from the MP4 file**:
    Open Command Prompt and run the following command:
    ```sh
    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -q:a 0 -map a output.wav
    ```
    Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your MP4 file and `output.wav` with the desired output audio file name.

3. **Install Whisper**:
    Follow the installation instructions for Whisper from the [OpenAI GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper).

4. **Transcribe the audio file**:
    Use Whisper to transcribe the audio file to text. Run the following command:
    ```sh
    whisper output.wav --model base --output_format txt
    ```
    Replace `output.wav` with the path to your extracted audio file.

5. **View the transcribed text**:
    The transcription will be saved in a `.txt` file in the same directory as your audio file.

This process will convert your MP4 video file to a text transcription.
