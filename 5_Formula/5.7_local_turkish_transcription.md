# 5.7 Generating a Local Turkish Transcript

Generating a local Turkish transcript is a smart move for privacy and to avoid ongoing subscription costs. Since it's 2026, local AI models have become significantly more efficient, allowing even standard laptops to handle high-quality transcription.

## 1. The Professional Choice: OpenAI Whisper (Free & Open Source)

**Whisper** is the gold standard for local transcription. It supports Turkish natively and runs entirely on your hardware.

### For Non-Technical Users (GUI Tools)

If you don't want to use code, use a "wrapper" that puts a visual interface on Whisper:

* **Buzz (Windows/Mac/Linux):** A popular open-source desktop app. You just drag your video in, select **Turkish**, and hit "Transcribe."
* **MacWhisper (macOS):** Specifically optimized for Mac (especially M1/M2/M3 chips). It's extremely fast and has a dedicated Turkish language setting.
* **OfflineTranscribe:** A Windows-based tool specifically designed for offline use that supports Turkish and keeps all data on your device.

### For Technical Users (Command Line)

If you have Python installed, you can run this in your terminal:

1. **Install:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai-whisper
   ```

2. **Run:**
   ```bash
   whisper "your_video.mp4" --model medium --language Turkish
   ```

> **Note:** Use `--model medium` or `--model large` for the best accuracy in Turkish.

## 2. Dedicated Local Software (One-time Purchase)

If you prefer a polished, supported application, several tools are now available in 2026 that focus on Turkish accuracy:

| Tool | Platform | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VoiceMasterTurkish** | Windows | Specifically trained on Turkish regional accents and dialects. |
| **360Converter** | Win/Mac | High-volume batch processing without cloud uploads. |
| **OfflineTranscription.com** | macOS/iOS | Privacy-focused; utilizes Apple's Neural Engine for speed. |

## 3. Important Setup Tips

* **Hardware Check:** Turkish is a "morphologically rich" language. For high accuracy, use the **Medium** or **Large** model versions. These typically require at least **8GB–16GB of RAM** or a GPU with **6GB+ VRAM**.

* **File Prep:** If your video file is massive, you can speed up the process by extracting the audio first (as an `.mp3` or `.wav`) using a tool like VLC or FFmpeg, then transcribing only the audio:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i your_video.mp4 -q:a 0 -map a audio_only.wav
  whisper audio_only.wav --model large --language Turkish --output_format srt
  ```

* **Accuracy:** Local models might occasionally struggle with very fast "Istanbul Turkish" or heavy slang. Always export as an **.srt** or **.txt** so you can do a quick manual pass for any minor "hallucinations."
