Here's a script that extracts audio from a video file, transcribes it using Whisper, and appends the transcription to a text file named with the current date. If the file already exists, it will append the new transcription to it:

```python
import whisper
import subprocess
import datetime

# Path to your .mov file
mov_file = "/workspaces/whisper/6_Symbols/Timeline.mov"
audio_file = "/workspaces/whisper/6_Symbols/temp_audio.wav"
output_file = f"/workspaces/whisper/6_Symbols/transcription_{datetime.date.today()}.txt"

# Extract audio using ffmpeg
subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-i", mov_file, "-ar", "16000", "-ac", "1", "-q:a", "3", "-acodec", "pcm_s16le", audio_file])

# Load the Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model("base")  # Use 'small', 'medium', or 'large' for more accuracy
result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

# Append the transcription to the output file
with open(output_file, "a") as f:
    f.write(result["text"] + "\n")

print(f"Transcription appended to {output_file}")
```

### Steps to Execute:
1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 6_Symbols
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install whisper ffmpeg-python
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python vrollprocess.pl
   ```

This script will create or append to a file named `transcription_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` with the transcription of the audio extracted from your video file. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
